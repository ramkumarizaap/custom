We aren’t your mom & pop tailors. We were people just like you looking for something nice and simple: a place to buy a perfectly fitted bespoke custom suit that didn’t cost an arm and a leg.

After years of settling for clothing that were always over-priced and unspectacular, we decided to create the brand we always seemed to be looking for ourselves.

Our approach is simple: Quality is the most important thing. Our clothing has to be awesome so we wanted only the finest quality fabrics. And finally, try our best to offer it at the best possible price.

The custom suits and shirts you see today at our stores and on our site is the culmination of our dreams. Please let us know what you think and we’ll do what we can to make it happen.

Thank you for choosing us!
